Transaction and payment-related information.

Property listings categorized by for rent, for sale, sold, and rented statuses.

Ensured that users only see property details exactly as listed and managed by the admin.

Built logic to calculate revenue analytics on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis based on transaction records and also in a graphical format.

Implemented role-based access control to restrict unregistered users from accessing confidential pages and sensitive credentials.

Applied JWT-based authentication to protect private routes and secure user sessions.

Worked on adding property location details so users can clearly identify the exact physical location of listed houses.

Collaborated with database logic to ensure accurate synchronization between admin actions and user-facing content.

Challenges Solved:
